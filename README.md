# Meshtastic Discrete-Event Simulator ‚Äì Assignment EX2

## üìù Assignment Description

In this assignment, we were asked to:
- Understand the basic principles of the **Meshtastic** communication system.
- **Design and implement** a **time-discrete simulator** for a Meshtastic network.
- Support **at least 100 nodes** (clients) in simulation.
- Include a **flexible configurator** to modify key parameters.
- Provide **statistics** about messages sent/received.
- Optionally include a **GUI for debugging**.
- Include some form of **RF link budget model**.
- It is permitted (and recommended) to use **open-source projects**.

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview

To meet the assignment requirements, I used the official open-source project:  
üëâ [`Meshtasticator`](https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtasticator)

This is a Python-based discrete-event simulator developed by the Meshtastic team. It simulates the radio behavior of Meshtastic devices, allowing message scheduling, routing, propagation modeling, and logging of statistics.

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtasticator.git
cd Meshtasticator
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run simulation with 100 nodes (non-GUI mode)
```bash
python3 loraMesh.py 100
```

### 4. (Optional) Run with GUI for manual node placement
```bash
python3 loraMesh.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

You can edit `lib/config.py` to change:

- `MODEM`: Set radio mode (e.g., SF7-SF12)
- `PERIOD`: Mean time between messages per node
- `PKT_LEN`: Packet size in bytes
- `PROP_MODEL`: RF propagation model (e.g., log-distance, Okumura-Hata)
- `DMs`: Use direct messaging instead of broadcast
- `MINDIST`: Minimum spacing between nodes

---

## üìä Output and Statistics

The simulator generates:
- A visual plot of node layout and message timeline
- A summary of:
  - Number of messages sent per node
  - Number of messages received
  - Duplicate message ratio
  - Collisions
  - Average number of hops
- Optional batch results saved in `/out/report/` when using `batchSim.py`

---

## üß™ Example Scenario

I ran a simulation of 100 nodes using:
- Broadcast messages
- Log-distance RF model
- SF7 radio setting
- Mean message interval of 300 seconds

The simulation showed:
- High reachability across the mesh
- Some message duplication due to rebroadcasting
- Collision events depending on node density

---

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI (Optional for Debugging)

When running `loraMesh.py` without arguments:
- A GUI window appears
- You can place nodes manually and configure each one (router, hop limit, etc.)
- Click "Start" to begin the simulation

## üìÅ Files in This Project

- `loraMesh.py`: Main simulator
- `lib/config.py`: Configuration settings
- `batchSim.py`: Run multiple simulations for statistical analysis
- `plotExample.py`: Plot results from batch runs
- `/out/`: Output folder for logs, node configs, and reports

---

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Notes

- If the GUI crashes on your system, simply run `loraMesh.py` with a node count argument to bypass the interactive window.
- The simulation can be extended with different propagation models or custom routing logic if needed.
